# Advent of Code 2023

Attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge using modern C++ features (WIP).

The code has been developed in Visual Studio 17.9 preview 1.1 and/or g++ 13.1, targeted C++ version is C++23.

At time of writing, it's probably not possible to build this project with older VS versions or other compilers as newest C++ 23 features are being used (for example `<mdspan>`, construction of containers from ranges with `std::from_range`, etc.).
